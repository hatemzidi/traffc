# traffc: your road companion

THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED NOW - FEEL FREE TO CONTINUE IT.

This is just a minimalistic mobile application using Google Maps to ~~quickly~~ visualize your location's traffic condition.

There are a lot of existing similar services, web pages or mobile apps, and they are may be more sophisticated, but I was totally bothered by their design and the ads.
I needed something simple, minimalistic and yet light to render on any web browser (desktop, mobile ...)

traffc is a full standalone HTML5 page, with almost no backend.

You can check [whatis.traffc.info](http://whatis.traffc.info/) for more info.

## Live demo
A similar web app version is available at [traffc.info](http://traffc.info/)

The nightly version is at [dev.traffc.info](http://dev.traffc.info/)
